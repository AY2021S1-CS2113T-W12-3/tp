## 1. Introduction

### 1.a Purpose

This guide aims to provide information for you: the developers, testers and future contributors of **WatchNext** 
such that you will have an easy reference for understanding the features implemented in **WatchNext**.


### 1.b Scope

The guide outlines the architecture and design decisions for the implementation of WatchNext.The intended audience of this 
document are the developers, testers and future contributors of WatchNext.
   

## 2. Setting up
This section will show you the requirements that you need to fulfill in order to quickly start contributing to this project in no time!

### 2.a Prerequisites

1. **JDK `11`**  

[NOTE]
The `WatchNext.jar` file is compiled using the Java version mentioned above. +

2. **IntelliJ IDEA** IDE

[NOTE]
IntelliJ has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed by default.
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

 ### 2.b Setting up the project in your computer
 
 **Fork** this [repo](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W12-3/tp), and clone the fork to your computer.
 
1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)

2. You should set up the correct JDK version for Gradle

3. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`

4. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK

5. Click `Import Project`

6. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`

7. Click `Open as Project`

8. Click `OK` to accept the default settings

9. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all the resources required by the application and tests.

 ### 2.c Verifying the setup

1. You can run `Duke` and try a few commands.

2. You can also run tests using our instructions for manual testing to explore our features.

 ### 2.d Before Writing Code
 
 1. Set up CI
 
 This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the master branch or to any PR. No set up required.
 
 2. Learn the design
 
 When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about WatchNextâ€™s architecture [here](#3-design).
