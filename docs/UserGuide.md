### 1.a What does **WatchNext** do?

**WatchNext** is a program made for teenagers and young adults.For users who use multiple free streaming platforms or other open source stream websites,
the application will track their progress in the different shows they watch, and the upcoming shows they wish to watch.In addition, it provides a timer 
to limit your weekly show progress to help manage your time.

**WatchNext** is optimized for users who prefer to work with the Command Line Interface (CLI).


### 1.b Why use **WatchNext**?
**WatchNext** allows users who watch shows on multiple free streaming platforms or other open source stream websites.It is very difficult and especially taxing to track your favourite shows through browser bookmarks, 
especially for younger teenagers and adults who serve a large part of the user demographic in consuming said media.

This motivated our team to create an application that would not only help track all your shows, but also potentially create a community where everyone will be able to share their favourite shows and their current watchlist.
