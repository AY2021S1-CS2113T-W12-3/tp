## 1. Introduction

<img src = "images/quickstart.PNG" width = "600">

#### **WatchNext** is a show tracker made for teenagers and young adults.
<br><br> 
### 1.a. What is **WatchNext**?

**WatchNext** is a show tracker designed for users who watch their favourite shows on multiple free streaming platforms and other open source streaming websites.
**WatchNext** records your progress for the different shows you are currently watching, and even for upcoming shows that you plan to watch.
<br>It additionally serves as a tracker to limit your weekly watch time to help you better manage your time.
<br>For students, **WatchNext** serves the same purpose of tracking your learning progress for lectures and webcasts.
<br><br>This motivated our team to create an application that would not only help track all your shows and lectures, 
but also foster a community where everyone will be able to share their watchlist with like-minded individuals and friends. <br>

### 1.b. Why use **WatchNext**?
It is difficult and can be taxing to track your favourite shows through browser bookmarks.
This is especially pertinent for younger teenagers and adults who make up a large part of video entertainment media consumers.

For students, there is also a need to manually track lecture videos and webcast progress as lecturers may use different learning management systems.

**WatchNext** is optimized for users who prefer to work with the Command Line Interface (CLI).<br> 


### 1.c. What will this guide do?

This guide aims to equip you with the knowledge on how to use our application by providing you with detailed examples for all of **WatchNext's** features. 
The features can be found in [Section 4: “Features”](#4-features-br).

Interested in using **WatchNext**? Jump to [Section 2: “Quick Start”](#2-quick-start) to get started now!

&nbsp;  

If you are unfamilar with the CLI (Command Line Interface), do give this helpful [guide](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring14/cos126/precepts/CommandPromptTutorial.pdf) by Princeton a quick read!

## 3. Command Format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` and within the `<>` field are the inputs that need to be supplied by the user e.g. rating `<SCORE>`.

* The maximum length for a Show `SHOWNAME` is 100 characters.

* The `<SHOWNAME>` to be entered is case-sensitive.<br><br>


## 4. Features <br>

#### 4.a. `help` and `example` - Provides a condensed help list

 The `help` command provides a list which contains information about all the possible accepted commands.
 
 Format:
  `help`
  
 Example of usage: Let's say you want a quick description of each available command in **WatchNext**. Simply typing `help`
 will display a condensed list of each command and description to you.
  
Expected outcome:
 
<img src = "images/help.PNG" width = "500">
 
&nbsp;

 >  **[NOTE]**
 >
 >  * The `help` command does not provide the correct format. The `example` command below provides the correct format for each command.

To supplement the `help` command, The `example` command provides the correct format for every command available in **WatchNext**.
 
 Format:
  `example`

Expected outcome:
 
<img src = "images/example.PNG" width = "500">

&nbsp;

 >  **[NOTE]**
 >  * The command format listed by the `example` command adheres to the same rules as the [command format in this user guide](#3-command-format).
 >  * The `example` command is meant to be a quick refresher on the correct format, and is in no way meant to replace the user guide.Please refer to the user guide if you want a better understanding of each command.

#### 4.b. `add` - Adds a show
 The `add` command adds a show into your existing watchlist.
 
  Format:
   `add <SHOWNAME> <NUMBER OF SEASONS> <NUMBER OF EPISODES PER SEASON> <DURATION OF EPISODE>`
   
   Examples of usage: 
     `add RunningMan 2 10,12 90` <br>
     `add Friends 3 10,20,30 25` <br><br>
  Explanation of input: <br>
  For the example input, `add Friends 3 10,20,30 25`, a show named `Friends` is being added.<br> The show has `3` seasons, where season 1 has `10` episodes, season 2 has `20` and season 3 has `30` episodes.
  <br>_Note how the `10`,`20` and `30` are separated by commas without spaces in between._<br>

  &nbsp;
 After keying in the input as shown in the image above, the next image shows the expected output.

 >
 >  * The `<DURATION OF EPISODE>` input, which is `25` in the Friends example, is in minutes.

 >  
 >  * You will need to input `<SHOWNAME>` as one word. If the name of your show contains more than one word you will need to input the name with no spaces (an example would be `<RunningMan>` or you may use `_` to represent a space and use `Running_Man`.)

 Before input:
 
 <img src = "images/watch_before.PNG" width = "800">
 &nbsp;
 To illustrate the change in your watch time limit, we have added the time limit to 120 minutes.
 The duration of the show friends is 60 minutes. the change in time limit can be seen in the expected outcome below. 
 
 
 Expected outcome:
  
 <img src = "images/watch_after.PNG" width = "800">
  
 &nbsp;
 
 Note from the expected outcome that the show WatchHistory has been updated from S1E1 to S1E2. That is because you have told the program that you have watched S1E1 of friends, and 
 are now watching S1E2 of friends!<br>
 
 In addition, the previously set time limit of 120 minutes has been reduced to 60 minutes.
 
### 4.m.b. `updatetimelimit` - update your watch time limit

### 5. FAQ 
<br>

**Q**: Is my watchlist saved after I exit the program?  

**A**: Of course! The watchlist is saved into a local storage file after every input entered by the user.The same file will be loaded up when you start **WatchNext** again.  <br><br> 

**Q**: Where can I find the watchlist file if I want to share it with my friends?  

**A**: The file will be stored in the same path as the jar file, inside the "data" folder. Look for `data/userData.txt`.  <br><br> 

**Q**: Can I edit my watchlist directly in the local file?  

**A**: Yes, it is possible but not recommended. The save file stores the data in a specific format. If the format is not consistent, **WatchList** will be unable to load up file. Your stored shows may disappear.  <br><br> 

**Q**: What should I do if there was an error while I was typing in some input?

**A**: It depends on the nature of the error. WatchNext provides insightful error messages which will inform and guide you on any actions necessary. <br><br> 

**Q**: What format should I use if I want to track my lectures?  

**A**: We suggest you try `add <MODULENAME> <TOPICS> <NUMBER OF LECTURES PER TOPIC,SEPERATED BY COMMAS> <DURATION OF LECTURE>`.However, feel free to be creative and think of any format that suits you!<br><br>
